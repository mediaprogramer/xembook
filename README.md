# What is XEMBook?
XEMBook is similar to a bankbook. XEMBook allows you to confirm the balance of your XEM—the native cryptocurrency for NEM—and its total value in JPY, and check your Importance Score (the score shows the importance based on the amount of XEM held in your account).
You can also find the current prices of XEM on each exchange and review the history of txs and returns from Harvesting. It is not required to log in to your account. Once you open your XEMBook, you can get the information in a single page just by entering your NEM address.
